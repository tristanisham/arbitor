# Arbitor
## A small Rust library to validate if files are really what they say they are.
<hr>

# Why?
There isn't a simple, small, standalone crate for just validating what type a file is with the nuance to allow you to simple get a boolean yes/no or a more complex (what version of this filetype is it)?

## PROJECT IS CURRENTLY ALPHA.
